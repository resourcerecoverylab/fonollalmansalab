        <h3>Feasibility Study to Implement Hydrothermal Liquefaction in Southeast Michigan</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy </p>
        <p>This collaboration between SWR2L, Great Lakes Water Authority, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Brown &amp; Caldwell, Genifuel, Univeristy of Michigan, and Wayne State. Genifuel) and two academic institutions (University of Michigan and Wayne State University). Our goal is to measure the sustainability of hydrothermal liquefaction for the treatment of sewage sludge. To this end, we are performing a life cycle assessment, a techno-economic analysis, and considering social aspects by interacting with the Delray community (neighborhood near the WRRF). We also testing the technology in the water resource recovery facility using Genifuelâ€™s pilot unit.</p>

        <h3>Treatment &amp; Treatment and resource recovery from hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous by-product </h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy , Water Research Foundation, GLWA</p>
        <p>Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is a chemical process that transform organic wastes into biocrude, a precursor for transportation fuels. However along with the Biocrude, HTL also produces a medium-high strength aqueous byproduct (HTL-aq). To ensure HTL implementation it is crucial that the treatment of HTL-aq is well understood and sustainable. Under this project we are using anaerobic digestion and chemical processes to recover biogas and ammonia. We are also evaluating the treatment of HTL-aq in bioreactors that simulate the activated sludge processes of WWRF.</p>

        <h3>Evaluating transformation and fate of PFAS during hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy </p>
        <p>Per- and polyfluoroalkayl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants that are threatening the application of biosolids for agricultural purposes. Hydrothermal Liquefaction could provide a solution for the removal of PFAS. For this project we are evaluating the transformation and fate of PFAS in a pilot and continuous HTL reactor from Genifuel. We are measuring PFAS in the influent and all the effluents of HTL (biocrude, gas, liquid and solid effluents). </p>

        <h3>Evaluating nitrification inhibition by propylene glycol in Austin Water Resource Recovery Facility</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> City of Austin (AW)</p>
        <p>In this collaboration with Austin Water we are using bench scale bioreactors to simulate Austin Water secondary treatment and study the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria by propylene glycol.</p>

        <h3>Unleashing Anaerobic Fungi in Anaerobic Digestion</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> University of Texas at Austin</p>
        <p>Lignocellulosic biomass is broadly available in the US and the conversion of these feedstocks into biofuels or biomaterials through anaerobic digestion could increase the amount of US energy sources dramatically. However, the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels requires costly and environmental damaging pretreatments to make plant material bioavailable. Anaerobic fungi, belonging to the phylum Neocallimastigomycota, can provide a solution for this. Anaerobic fungi are inherent in the rumen and are responsible for the digestion of plant material in ruminants (cows, sheepâ€¦). We are working in developing bioprocesses that simulate the rumen in order to grow anaerobic fungi.</p>
