          <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy</p>
          <p>
            This study is a collaborative effort between the SWRâ‚‚L, the Great Lakes Water Authority,
            Pacific Northwest National Lab, Brown and Caldwell, Genifuel, and two academic
            institutions: the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Our central
            aim is to measure the sustainability of hydrothermal liquefaction for treating
            sewage sludge. To achieve this, we are performing a life cycle assessment, a
            techno-economic analysis, and considering social aspects through interaction with
            the Delray community, a neighborhood located near the Water Resource Recovery
            Facility. Additionally, we are actively testing the technology using Genifuelâ€™s
            pilot unit directly at the water resource recovery facility.

        <h3>Treatment &amp; Treatment and Resource Recovery from Hydrothermal Liquefaction Aqueous By-product</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> U.S. Department of Energy, Water Research Foundation, The Great Lakes Water Authority</p>
        <p>
          Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is a chemical process that converts organic wastes into biocrude,
          which serves as a precursor for transportation fuels. However, in addition to biocrude, HTL
          also generates a medium-to-high strength aqueous byproduct (HTL-aq). For HTL to be successfully
          implemented, it is crucial to thoroughly understand and ensure the sustainable treatment of
          this HTL-aq. Under this project, we are employing anaerobic digestion and chemical processes
          to recover both biogas and ammonia from the HTL-aq. Furthermore, we are evaluating the treatment
          of HTL-aq in bioreactors designed to simulate the activated sludge processes typically found
          in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs).

        <h3>Evaluating Transformation and Fate of PFAS during Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Sewage Sludge</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> U.S. Department of Energy</p>
        <p>
          Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants that are threatening the
          application of biosolids for agricultural purposes. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) could offer
          a promising solution for the removal of PFAS. For this project, we are evaluating the transformation
          and fate of PFAS within a pilot-scale, continuous HTL reactor provided by Genifuel. We are measuring
          PFAS concentrations in the influent, as well as in all the effluents produced by the HTL process,
          including biocrude, gas, liquid, and solid streams.

        <h3>Evaluating Nitrification Inhibition by Propylene Glycol in Austin Water Resource Recovery Facility</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> City of Austin (AW)</p>
        <p>
          In this collaboration with Austin Water we are using bench scale bioreactors to simulate Austin
          Water secondary treatment and study the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria by propylene glycol.

        <h3>Unleashing Anaerobic Fungi in Anaerobic Digestion</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> University of Texas at Austin</p>
        <p>
          Lignocellulosic biomass is broadly available in the US and the conversion of these feedstocks into
          biofuels or biomaterials through anaerobic digestion could increase the amount of US energy sources
          dramatically. However, the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels requires costly and environmental
          damaging pretreatments to make plant material bioavailable. Anaerobic fungi, belonging to the phylum
          Neocallimastigomycota, can provide a solution for this. Anaerobic fungi are inherent in the rumen and
          are responsible for the digestion of plant material in ruminants (cows, sheepâ€¦). We are working in
          developing bioprocesses that simulate the rumen in order to grow anaerobic fungi.
